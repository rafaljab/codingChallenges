# Spot the Difference

## Question

This question is asked by Google. 
You are given two strings, `s` and `t` which only consist of lowercase letters. 
`t` is generated by shuffling the letters in `s` as well as potentially adding an additional random character. 
Return the letter that was randomly added to `t` if it exists, otherwise, return `’‘`.
Note: You may assume that at most one additional character can be added to `t`.

Ex: Given the following strings...

```
s = "foobar", t = "barfoot", return 't'
s = "ide", t = "idea", return 'a'
s = "coding", t "ingcod", return ''
```

```python
def spot_the_difference(s: str, t: str) -> str:
    diff = set(t) - set(s)
    if len(diff) > 0:
        return diff.pop()
    else:
        return ''
```
